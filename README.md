GridInfCuda
===========

A C++ library for approximate inference of grid-based Markov random fields on CUDA, focused especially on computer vision applications. The library currently implements the following algorithms:
* Loopy belief propagation
* Hierarchical belief propagation
* Iterated Conditional Modes
* Graph cut with alpha-beta swap
